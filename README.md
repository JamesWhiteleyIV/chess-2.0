# chess-2.0
2-D Chess game written in JavaScript

A fun, simple project I made after my first quarter at Oregon State University's 
Computer Science program.  

I re-wrote the code from the original C++ version in JavaScript to provide a GUI for the game.


*note: bug that freezes game when in check mate. Probably will not finish this since I have more 
important coding to do now adays :)

*note: This only works in Mozilla Firefox browser.
